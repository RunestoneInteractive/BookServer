# See https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/#path-dependencies. After some testing, Poetry v.1.1.6 allows both ``runestone`` to be specified in the dependencies as a PyPI package and here in the dev dependencies as a local install, and will prefer the local install here. The local install is necessary, since the tests aren't in the PyPI Runestone Components package.
