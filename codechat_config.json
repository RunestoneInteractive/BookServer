# The file must contain a single dict, with the following keys:
{
    # ``source_path``: optional; defaults to ``.``. A path to the root of the source tree. Relative paths are rooted in the directory containing this file.
    #"source_path": ".",

    # ``output_path``: required. A path to the root of the HTML output produced by this renderer. Relative paths are rooted in the directory containing this file.
    "output_path": "_build",

    # ``args``: required. A list of arguments to invoke the renderer. Each element of the list must be a string. Each string may optionally contain the following replacement values:
    #
    # - ``{project_path}``: an absolute path to the directory containing this file.
    # - ``{source_path}``: the ``source_path`` above, but as an absolute path.
    # - ``{output_path}``: the ``output_path`` above, but as an absolute path.
    "args": [
        # See https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-build.html.
        "sphinx-build",
        # The source directory.
        ".",
        # The output directory.
        "_build",
